$epitaph
Much better luck next time
A valiant effort
So close
R.I.P.
They will be missed
Should have ascended
Shouldn't have gone downstairs
Hubris
Not like this
An avoidable death
Skill issue
Maybe try an easier game
Should have read the wiki
Should have wished for a better weapon
That was entirely preventable
The RNG giveth and the RNG taketh away
At least the food was good
They died as they lived: confused
It seemed like a good idea at the time
Should have stayed on level 1
