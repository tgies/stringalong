$raw phrase
a nice straight road with nothing coming
concorde comes to pick everybody up
nothing is not comprehensible
built in fashion obsolescence
optimistic auto suggestion
snow evidence but on fire
doors that open and shut
negative trees firedance
get out before saturday
deconstructed amnesiac
everything in its place
facsimile transmission
lullaby in the bunker
this isnt happening
a grin like roadkill
hissing like piss
things fall apart
how to disappear
no blood no mess
ice age coming
knives out
morning bell
dollars and cents
citizen insane
kid a
idioteque
in limbo
care bears falling dead out of the sky
birds falling out of the sky
woods where no birds sing
farmland is turning to dust
people are frightened to leave their homes
the toys all kill the grown-ups
scrape me off the ceiling
nowadays I get panicked that I have ceased to exist
frozen to the spot as the flash bulbs erupt
glints amongst the ice
chaos on the streets
dropping like flies
everything washes over you like a shipwreck
