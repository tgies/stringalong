$hot take
Your [resume|degree|MBA|job title] is worthless.
Nobody owes you [a job|success|engagement|a raise].
The [9-5|corporate ladder|interview process|education system] is [broken|dead|a scam|a lie].
Most [CEOs|founders|managers|leaders] are [afraid|lying|burnt out|winging it].
If you're not [posting|networking|building|shipping] every day, you're falling behind.
Unpopular opinion: [meetings|emails|standups|OKRs] are a waste of time.
Stop [applying|interviewing|networking|hustling]. Start [building|shipping|creating|failing].
Your [boss|company|industry] doesn't care about you.
[LinkedIn|Twitter|The internet] changed my life. It can change yours too.
You don't need [investors|a cofounder|experience|permission]. You need [courage|discipline|a laptop|WiFi].
[Remote work|RTO|Hybrid work] is killing your [career|culture|soul].
[Tech jargon] is the future. Adapt or die.
Work-life balance is a myth for high performers.
Quiet quitting is just another word for laziness.
Soft skills are hard skills.
Your manager is not your mentor.
Networking isn't about collecting contacts. It's about planting seeds.
If your LinkedIn bio doesn't scare you, it's too small.
